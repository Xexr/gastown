With bd 0.56.1 (updated today), bd show cannot find ephemeral beads — same root cause as bd-hze6 / https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/issues/2053. The original Dolt write failure (2 of 7 lost under concurrency) may still be valid but is now overshadowed: ALL MR beads are invisible to bd show after the bd update. Once bd-hze6 is fixed, re-evaluate whether the original concurrency issue persists."}

This may now be by design. Needs re-evaluation: is the current behavior (polecat closes task bead on gt done) correct for the current workflow, or should the refinery still be the one closing after MR merge?"}
